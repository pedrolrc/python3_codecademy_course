I once went through the complete [Learn Python 3 Pro Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn).

It involve practicing several key Python 3 concepts as well as solving some challenges.

This repository stores all the code I wrote while taking the course, divided by each module.

Useful article for whoever is starting the Python 3 journey: https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/guide-essential-things-to-know-about-coding-from-day-one/394538/1
